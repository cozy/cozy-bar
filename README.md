What's Cozy?
------------

![Cozy Logo](https://cdn.rawgit.com/cozy/cozy-guidelines/master/templates/cozy_logo_small.svg)

[Cozy] is a platform that brings all your web services in the same private space.  With it, your webapps and your devices can share data easily, providing you with a new experience. You can install Cozy on your own hardware where no one's tracking you.


What's cozy-bar.js?
----------------

`cozy-bar.js` is a javascript library made by Cozy. It enables the _CozyBar_ component in your application. This component is a banner on the top of your application, responsible of cross-apps navigation, user facilities, intents, etc.


Use
---

`cozy-bar.js` is an asset directly served by the [cozy-stack](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-stack). To use it, simply add `<script src="/js/cozy-bar.js" defer></script>` in the `<head>` section of the `index.html` of your application. It exposes an API behind the `window.cozy.bar` namespace, that let you interact with the _CozyBar_ itself.

The library requires your markup to contain an element with `role=application` and attributes `data-cozy-domain` and `data-cozy-token`. The DOM of the banner will be added before this element.


Once you have the library included in your application, starts by intialize it in your app bootstrap:

```js
window.cozy.bar.init({
  appName: MY_APP_NAME,
  iconPath: PATH_TO_SVG_ICON,
  lang: LOCALE
})
```

`appName` param in hash is mandatory when `lang` and `iconPath` are optionals. If not passed, their values are detected into the DOM:

- `lang` is extracted from the `lang` attribute of the `<html>` tag. Defaults to 'en'
- `iconPath` uses the favicon 32px. Defaults to a blank GIF
