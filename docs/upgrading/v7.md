# Migrate cozy-bar from v7 to v11

To migrate cozy-bar from v7 to v11, follow these steps:

1. Update the cozy-bar as a dependency instead of a devDependency in your project by running the following command:
   ```bash
   yarn remove cozy-bar --dev && yarn add cozy-bar@11.0.0
   ```
You should also check whether the cozy-bar peerDeeps are filled in

2. In development mode, the cozy-scripts was injecting cozy-bar JS and CSS. In your `package.json` you need to disable this injection of files by adding the `--barV7 false` option to the `build`, `start`, and `watch` commands. Make sur your version of cozy-scripts is greater that `8.1.1`

3. In production, the cozy-stack replace `{{.CozyBar}}` with the JavaScript code to inject the cozy-bar. Make sure you remove all instances of `{{.CozyBar}}` from your `index.ejs` file.

4. You need to add the cozy-bar CSS `import 'cozy-bar/dist/stylesheet.css'` into your index or an other file

5. You can remove the bar initialization. Generally you can search for `cozy.bar.init({`

6. Add the `BarComponent` into your layout like the following code:
   ```jsx
   import { BarComponent } from 'cozy-bar'

   const App = () => {
       return (
           <Layout>
               <BarComponent />
           </Layout>
       )
   }
   ```

7. If you were using customs elements, you need to wrap the `BarComponent` and your elements into a `BarProvider`. Generally you can add this into providers file:
    ```jsx
    <BarProvider>
        <OtherProvider>
            {children}
        </OtherProvider>
    </BarProvider>
    ```

8. Then, replace `{ BarLeft } = cozy.bar` with a direct import:
   ```jsx
   import { BarLeft } from 'cozy-bar'

   const Title = ({ title }) => {
       const { isMobile } = useBreakpoints()

       if(isMobile) {
           return (
               <BarLeft>{title}</BarLeft>
           )
       }
       return (
           <h2>{title}</h2>
       )
   }
   ```

9. Remove all the wrapped providers because cozy-bar can consume them directly if `<BarComponent` is below them.
